# Frontend for AssemblyAI Challenge

This is the frontend for the [AssemblyAI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/assemblyai), built using Vue, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Simulation Mode

You can run the frontend without connecting to the actual device by using the built-in **Simulation Mode**. 
This mode allows you to preview the interface with auto-generated `lorem ipsum` content for all three available functions.

### How to Activate Simulation Mode

1. Start the development server as described above.
2. Append `?simulated=true` to the URL in your browser. For example: `http://localhost:3000?simulated=true`

This will enable the simulation mode and showcase the functionality as if the device were connected.
